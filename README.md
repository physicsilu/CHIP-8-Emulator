CHIP-8 Emulator

This project is done for my learning and understanding the concepts of C programming and basics of processors.

The "old" folder contains the code which I have initialliy written and has few bugs. I used [Building a CHIP-8 Emulator [C++]](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/#how-does-a-cpu-work) as reference. It has the graphics are implemented in SDL. My code is written in C, so I have used my creativity here a bit! :)

The other chip8 emulator is built referring to [CHIP 8 Emulator](https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master). The code is almost the same. All credit goes to David Matlack. OpenGL and GLUT are used to implement the graphics here.

I have made some notes while writing the code. You can see them in "notes.txt" file
